features:
  - title: Modular
    details: Visualizations are constructed out of simpler components, which are again constructed out of even simpler components. A nice component hierarchy.
  - title: No overhead on mount
    details: Doing a lot of D3 stuff in beforeMount, which makes updating data really ugly? Vue Data Components avoids that. This allows things like the handling of live data.
  - title: Modifiable
    details: Due to its modular nature, each visualization can be modified to its core. A diagonal axis? Ugly, but no problem. No flexibility of D3 that you know and love gets lost.
