  - title: Modular
    details: Visualizations are constructed out of simpler components, which are again constructed out of even simpler components. A nice component hierarchy.
  - title: No overhead on mount
    details: Doing a lot of D3 stuff in beforeMount, which makes updating data really ugly? Vue Data Components avoids that.
  - title: Reactive
    details: Change the data source however you like, resize the window. No problem.
